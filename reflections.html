									<h2>Summarizations</h2>
									<p>To sum up, I find web programming to be a really difficult subject. I will still give it a shot because I enjoy learning new things. I'm going to try to get an amazing grade on this subject with the assistance of my instructor and friend. I can apply what I've learned to create this web at work as well. There is a great deal of demand for this subject's connected jobs. I hope the individual taking this subject will get deeply into it with a lot of emotion since it will be useful in the future.</p>

									<h3>Improvement</h3>
									<p>Among the enhancements that can be achieved is extensive training. this is due to the fact that knowledge increases with training. It is therefore feasible that we will be able to quickly address any queries or issues you may have with this web programming.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, independent learning is also crucial. This is to help someone learn things outside of the classroom that they cannot learn in a classroom. We will naturally be superior to our friends when we learn things that are not covered in class. With it, we can also impart to them the new information. students will be able to apply the new knowledge they acquire to their everyday life at the same time.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, there is room for improvement in terms of the syllabus covered. Students will be learning things every year that others do not learn thanks to the new syllabus, so this issue is very significant to them. In this case, the lecturer's involvement is crucial in deciding which syllabus the students must complete. Not to be overlooked, more recent notes must be supplied in order to enhance students' comprehension.</p>

									<h2>Idea or Creativity</h2>
                                    <p>Students can also effectively learn new concepts through extracurricular study. this is due to the fact that the learning process is tedious, causing students to become disinterested and simply nod off. In addition to the lecturer's compassionate approach to the pupils, the effort is highly successful. Teachers must come up with innovative ideas to pique pupils' interest in this subject.</p>
									<p>Additionally, participating in different web programming competitions has a significant impact on the pupils. With this, they will thoroughly research in order to meet the competition's standards. Give pupils something of value, like cash or certificates, to pique their interest in pursuing a career in web programming. Once a winner has been selected, declare their name or group so that other kids can take note and emulate this admirable action.</p>
