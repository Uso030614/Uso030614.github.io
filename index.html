												<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
												<p>I began in Kika Kindergarten, a kindergarten in Manjung, Perak. I didn't study very much in this kindergarten and didn't know much about spelling. I then progressively transferred to Sekolah Kebangsaan Tanjung Tokong for primary education. For the record, I received 5As, which is fantastic for UPSR. I attended Sekolah Menengah Sains Labuan to finish my education. I have to take the SPM exam, which is a significant exam, here. Thank God, I passed the exam with 6 As and 3 Bs. Prior to pursuing my education at UTM, I attended Asasi Dengkil UITM Dengkil. not as enjoyable because COVID-19 was in effect at the time.</p>

												<h3>POSITION</h3>
												<p>I don't currently hold a position at the UTM level. I was able to serve as the KKDK Club's third deputy president, though. My goal is to make the KKDK Club more well-known so that every student is aware of it. this is a result of the club's poor public relations. To top it all off, I consider myself to be a student who aspires to succeed and make my parents pleased.</p>

												<h3>SKILLS</h3>
												<p>I'm improvising a talent related to programming. where I acquired my C++ and Java language skills. These two languages are not hard, but I still need to learn them thoroughly. this is because I will definitely apply the knowledge I have gained about the subject at work in the future. I am eager to learn new things and truly appreciate picking up new languages.</p>
